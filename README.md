What a thrill\
With darkness and silence through the night\
What a thrill\
I'm searching and I'll melt into you\
What a fear in my heart\
But you're so supreme!

I give my life\
Not for honor, but for you\
In my time, there'll be no one else\
Crime, it's the way I fly to you \
I'm still in a dream.. marble eater

I am stillll in a dream... MARBLE EATER!\
(Lyrics taken from Opening song of MGS3: Snake Eater)
